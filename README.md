This project allowed to translate mocha ( http://mtc.epfl.ch/software-tools/mocha/ ) to BLIF-MV ( http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~vis/doc/blifmv/blifmv/blifmv.html ).

Boy that's quite embarrassing Java code on my side. Needless to say you should
approach this as more of a proof-of-concept, and not a tool to model check your
nuclear power plant control circuits ;-)

But it was a fun course ( http://mtc.epfl.ch/courses/ModelChecking-2007/ ), so
I thought I'd add it here.
